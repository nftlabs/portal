## Intro

So you want full control? thirdweb's got you. Let me show you how to create your **NFTs**, your own **coins** (tokens) and then list your **NFTs** for sale in your own **tokens** on your own **marketplace**.

## Step 1 - Mint Your NFTs

To create an NFT module, check out [this guide](/learn/introduction).

Once you got your `NFT Collection` module all set up, it's time to mint those babies.

If you're Minting NFTs in Python, you want [this](/guides/mint-nft-collection-with-python-sdk) guide and if you're doing it in TypeScript, you'll need [this](/guides/mint-nft-collection-using-typescript-sdk) guide.

Want no-code? Got you, check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW4AF5nejyg) video.

## Step 2 - Create Your Tokens

Cool you minted your **NFTs**, well done. Now let's create our own **coins**. We will need the `Token` module for this. Creating the `Token` module is the same as creating the `NFT Collection` module (but you do need to click on `Token` when you pick a module ðŸ˜œ).

Once you got your `Token` module, you can mint the tokens straight in the dashboard.

Want to use code? No worries. Click [here](/guides/create-your-currency-with-python-sdk) for Python and [here](/guides/create-your-currency-with-typescript-sdk) for TypeScript.

## Step 3 - Create Your Own Marketplace

We're almost there! This step is actually pretty simple. Go to the dashboard, create a **module** in your project and pick `Marketplace` as your module.

That's it ðŸ˜¶.

## Step 4 - List YOUR NFTs in YOUR Coins on YOUR Marketplace!

To list your **NFTs** in your own **marketplace**, go to your project and inside your project to your `NFT Collection` module. You should see in the button `List` next to your **NFT**.

Click on it, follow the steps and choose your **marketplace** and your **token** (by clicking on your token contract) in the dropdown boxes.

Want to use code? Look at you! 

okokok.

Check out [this](/guides/create-a-marketplace-with-python-sdk) guide for Python and [this](/guides/create-your-own-marketplace-with-thirdweb-typescript-sdk) guide for TypeScript to list your nfts on your marketplace.

## THAT'S IT

You've done it.

You've taken full control. 

NO dependancy on someone else's smartcontract for YOUR NFTs

NO dependancy on someone else's tokens.

NO dependecy on someone else's marketplace.
