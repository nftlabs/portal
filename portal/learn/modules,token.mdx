## In a nutshell

The `Token` module is suited for projects in which you want to create your own currency. This currency can be purchased and traded between users on an exchange, utilized to buy and sell NFTs in a marketplace, and much more.

This can be combined with other contracts like `NFT Drop` , `Splits` , `Bundle Drop` , and `Marketplace` for even greater functionality.

The `Token` module is a smart contract, which is compliant with the ERC20 standard. A thirdweb module is actually more than _just_ a smart contract.

Click [here](/learn/modules) to learn more about modules and how to create them.

## The settings

The following settings can be adjusted, when you create an `Token` module:

- Name
- Description
- Image
- Symbol (used to publicly identify your token)

## What can you do with our module?

The following use cases are suited for the `Token` module

1. Offering the sale of a token or currency in your own marketplace or another exchange
2. Enable users to buy and sell NFTs within your marketplace
3. Give your community a share of voice using governance tokens
4. Restricted transfer (check out this use case with Bundle Drop [here](/guides/make-your-nft-non-transferable))
5. Wrapping and unwrapping tokens along with the Bundle module

## How it works

You can create your own token using the dashboard or SDK. When you mint tokens, the connected wallet pays for the gas fees. If you mint it via the dashboard, your wallet pops up to confirm the transactions. If you mint via code, you won't see this explicit request to authorize the transaction.

Once you've successfully minted your tokens, you can see the tokens in your dashboard or with the print/call function using the SDK.

## How to use the module

You can use the `Token` module with or without code:

1. TypeScript
2. Python
3. Dashboard Embed (our no-code solution)

### Setup your dev environment

To interact with your `Token` with code, you need to follow 3 steps:

1. Install the necessary packages on your (local) machine
   1. Ethers on typescript
   2. Dotenv / virtual-env
   3. Typescript / Python
   4. tslib when using Typescript
2. Instantiate the SDK
3. Passing the address of the Module inside your code

To install the necessary packages for TypeScript or Python on your (local) machine and instantiate the SDK in your code, check out [this](/guides/sdk-guide) guide to help you with that. Note, you can instantiate the SDK in multiple ways, so make sure to check out that guide.

You can find the module address in the thirdweb dashboard, inside your project or inside the `Token` itself.

In order to make use of our SDK, you need to establish a connection to a blockchain. ClickÂ [here](learn/connect-to-blockchain)Â to learn how to connect to the blockchain and instantiate our SDK.

For this guide, you will need to instantiate the SDK followingÂ [these](/learn/connect-to-blockchain#using-your-own-signer-with-thirdweb)Â steps, using your own signer with thirdweb.

Here's an example of doing this in TypeScriptðŸ‘‡

```jsx
// Instantiate Token module
const token = sdk.getTokenModule("0x74846071E984C0039c597b0f3975814d111eF5F6");
// Set the amount of currency you want to mint
// (Actual amount, number of decimals)
const amount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 18);

// Minting the currency, 1000 Pratham coin
async function mintCurrency() {
  console.log(await token.mint(amount));
}

// Running the entire thing
mintCurrency();
```

And here is one in Python ðŸ‘‡

```python
#pick your module and enter the smart contract address
token_module = sdk.get_currency_module("<TOKEN_MODULE_ADDRESS>")
#blockchain converts numbers with 18 decimals
input_amount = 1000
converted_amount = amount* (10**18)
#mint the token
token_module.mint(converted_amount)
```
