## Create a Project with thirdweb

With thirdweb you can mint NFT's, create drops and build your own marketplace. All of this is done inside Projects and Modules. In this guide we'll create a Project with the dashbaord. If you don't know what **Projects** and **Modules** are, then [click here.](/learn/introduction)

### Navigate to Dashboard

Head over to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and connect your wallet, select a network and create a project. We will be working on the Rinkeby test network in this guide.

When you go to the website, you should run in to the following landpage.
