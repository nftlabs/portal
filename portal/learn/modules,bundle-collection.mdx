## In a nutshell

With the `NFT Collection` module, every NFT has an unique ID with an unique image. The `Bundle Collection` module letâ€™s you mint multiple NFTs based on the same image or music file. Hereâ€™s how that worksðŸ‘‡

If you want to know more about creating modules, click [here](/learn/modules).

## How it works

The `Bundle Collection` is used to create NFTs, but also has powerful features, such as wrapping your tokens and NFTs. The `Bundle Collection` module can:

1. Mint an NFT Collection
2. Wrap Tokens
3. Wrap NFTs

## Mint an NFT Collection

With the `Bundle Collection` module you can create an NFT and then pass a supplyðŸ‘‡

Each of these NFTsðŸ‘†share the same ID and same image, but now you can have multiple of these. This type of NFT is also called `one-of-many` with ERC-1155. Like this you can mint your own NFT collection. These NFTs can be listed for sale on any NFT platform or your own marketplace (created with third webâ€™s `Marketplace` module).

## Wrap Tokens & NFTs

This module allows you to wrap `Tokens` and `NFTs`. Wrapping makes a token which is created on a certain standard (like ERC-20), available in another standard(like ERC-721). The original token is **locked** in one standard and then a representation of that token is created in the new standard.
This is useful if let's say you want to convert a token (ERC-20) to an NFT (ERC-721). thirdweb's wrapping feature takes care of that for you.

## How to use

You can use the `Bundle Collection` by using code or no-code. Head over to our dashboard to make use of the no-code solution. To use the code solution, you need to install our packages and instantiate our sdk first. Check out [this](/learn/connect-to-blockchain) page on how to do that. Youâ€™ll also need the address of your `Bundle Collection` module. You can find that in the dashboard, inside your project.

### Examples

Hereâ€™s an example on how to create an NFT in TypeScript

```jsx
// The Bundle collection module address received after initializing the Bundle module on the dashboard.
const bundleAddress = "<MODULE_ADDRESS>";
// Initialize the Bundle collection module with the contract address.
const bundleCollection = sdk.getBundleModule(bundleAddress);
const createAndMintNft = async (nft) => {
  try {
    await bundleCollection.createAndMint(nft);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};
createAndMintNft({
  name: "<NFT_NAME>",
  description: "<DESCRIPTION>",
  image: "<LINK>",
  properties: "PROPERTIES_OBJECT",
  initialSupply: "<INITIAL_SUPPLY_INT",
});
```
