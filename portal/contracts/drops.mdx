With these contracts youâ€™ll be able to set up a mint for users to mint ERC-721 **NFT Drop** (one owner per NFT) or ERC-1155 **Edition Drop** (multiple owners per NFT).

These contracts are perfect for when you create all the NFTs or tokens beforehand, then have them so your audience can mint them, if otherwise what you want is to mint them all yourself to list them on a marketplace or do an airdrop, you should check [NFTs and Tokens](/contracts/nfts-and-tokens).
