## Create a Contract in thirdweb

With thirdweb you can mint NFTs, create drops and build your own marketplace. In this guide we'll deploy a contract on your thirdweb dashboard.

### Create new contract

From your dashboard, first select 'Create new contract'.

### Select network

Next, you will be prompted to select which network to deploy this contract. For this tutorial, we will select Rinkeby - the testnet for Ethereum. You will need Rinkeby ETH to deploy this contract.

### Select contract

Pick the contract you want want to build. In this tutorial we want to create a drop, so we first select 'Release a drop' then 'NFT Drop' for this contract.

### Customize contract

Go ahead and fill in a name, image, description, and royalty percentage for your contract. Also, you can change 'Primary' and 'Royalty' recipient addresses as needed. These default to your wallet used to create the contract. When you are ready, click 'Deploy now'.
