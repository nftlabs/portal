With these contracts youâ€™re able to mint your own ERC-20 **Token** (like ETH, MATIC, WETH, etc.), ERC-721 **NFT Collection** (one owner per NFT), ERC-1155 **Edition** (multiple owners per NFT), and **Pack** (randomized rewards or loot boxes full of NFTs).

These contracts are perfect for when you want to mint all the tokens or NFTs yourself, for when you want to list them directly in a [Marketplace](/contracts/marketplace) or when you want to do an airdrop. If otherwise what you want is for your audience to mint your NFTs or tokens after you create them, you should check our [Drops](/contracts/drops).
