## I want to use thirdweb in my app

When you want these awesome features of thirdweb to **live** inside your current application or you just want to build an entire new app **with** our features, you use our sdk's. Depending on what you want to do, you can use our sdk's in different ways.

Lets **oversimplify** this. You have a **frontend** and a **backend**. Where does your thirdweb sdk code live?

## Frontend

Here is a typical use case. You have an app (or are building one) and you want users to claim an nft. You have everything set up and just want that button. In this case you integrate our sdk in the frontend. The user triggers a transaction and the frontend(or client side) interacts with the blockchain.

Example: I click on the `claim` button and the client side makes sure my wallet pops up and I authorise the transaction.

thirdweb has created a hook for React and Nextjs apps to give your app a `connect wallet` functionality and a hook to connect & interact with your contracts via our sdk.

If you want to know more about how a connection with a blockchain works, click [here](/learn-thirdweb/connect-to-blockchain).

### Code to instantiate the SDK at the Client Side (frontend)

To use the SDK in your frontend, first make sure you make use of the thirdweb component to connect your wallet to your app. If you want to know more about our `Connect Wallet` component, click [here](/guides/add-connectwallet-to-your-website).
In this example we will make use of the hook for Metamask, but we have hooks for the most popular wallets. Check it out [here](https://docs.thirdweb.com/react).

Inside your components folder, create a file `ConnectWithMetamask.js` with the following code:

```jsx:ConnectWithMetamask.js
import { useMetamask } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export const ConnectWithMetamask = () => {
  // get a function to connect to a particular wallet
  // options: useMetamask() - useCoinbaseWallet() - useWalletConnect()
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();
  return (
    <button onClick={connectWithMetamask}>Connect Metamask Wallet</button>
  );
};
```

Inside your `Marketplace.js` we can import the hook `useMarketplace` to connect and interact with our marketplace contract.

```js:Marketplace.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useMarketplace } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

export default function MarketPlace() {
  const marketplace = useMarketplace(
    '0xf4e8C436d87Bd4cB1416E474948105FdF80BB6A0',
  );
  const [listings, setListings] = useState([]);

  // using a method inside our sdk
  useEffect(() => {
    const getAllListings = async () => {
      try {
        const result = await marketplace?.getAllListings();
        setListings(result);
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
    };
    getAllListings();
  }, [marketplace]);

  return <p>My listings: {listings?.map((listing) => listing.name)}</p>;
}
```

Now we can use both components in our app, by importing them into our `App.js`.

```js:App.js
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import React from "react";
import "./App.css";
import Marketplace from "./components/Marketplace";
import ConnectWithMetamask from "./components/ConnectWithMetamask"

// define the chains that your app can support.
// every chain like polygon(137) or rinkeby(4) has an ID
// If you want add other chains, search for their IDs and add them to the array below
// If you want to support all chain, don't pass this property
const supportedChains = [4, 137];

// here we 'wrap' the components inside the thirdweb tags,
// to ensure our component can make use of the selected chain(s)
export default function App() {
  return (
return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={4} supportedChains={supportedChains}>
      <ConnectWithMetamask />
      <Marketplace >
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

You can get a full `<ConnectWallet />` component with other providers from [this guide](/guides/add-connectwallet-to-your-website).

## Backend

If you have read functionalities that you want to integrate in your app or less frequent writing needs, server side is your choice.

Methods like `getAllListings` that well....get all your listings are much more suited to live server side and computed over there.

An example where you write are your rules on claiming an NFT. Perhaps you got some conditions an user needs to comply. This code is suited for your backend.

If you want an example of a guide that shows you how to use the sdk on the backend, check out [this](/guides/create-a-drop-with-typescript-sdk) guide.

### Reading: Code to just read some stuff

If we just want to read out some data, we don't need to pass our **private keys**. We can use the below setup to read out data on the blockchain, which can be useful if you want to get all the listings on your marketplace. Regardless of whether the user will be connected to your app, the listings and images will still show.

This is how to instantiate the `sdk`, when all you want is to read data.

```tsx
const ethers = require("ethers");
// Your rpc URL here
// RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call and is a simple form of API interaction
// Every chain has a rpc url, this is Rinkeby's public one
const rpcUrl = "https://rinkeby-light.eth.linkpool.io/";

const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider(rpcUrl);

const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(provider);
```

### Writing: Code to instantiate the SDK at the server-side (backend)

To use the SDK at the server side, the object `sdk` is instantiated different. It makes use of the **private keys** of a wallet. You can import the private keys, using the **dotenv** library. In the same folder you would need a `.env` file to store the private keys.

```bash:.env
PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key-here>
```

Don't commit this `PRIVATE_KEY` to GitHub(in other words, include `.env` in gitignore) or anywhere else.

Your `index.ts` looks like this, when you instantiate the `sdk` with **private keys**.

```tsx
// Importing libraries
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

// getting the private key
dotenv.config();

// Instantiate 3rdweb SDK
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(
  new ethers.Wallet(
    // Your wallet private key
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string,
    // This is the RPC URL for Rinkeby
    ethers.getDefaultProvider("https://rinkeby-light.eth.linkpool.io/"),
  ),
);
```
