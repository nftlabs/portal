## Intro

In this guide we'll create an **auction** on our own **marketplace** with the TypeScript SDK! In a **marketplace** you can list your tokens, like NFT's, for sale. Opensea is an example of a **marketplace**.
Did you know you can do both! We will list an NFT from the NFT Collection contract. If you don't have any NFTs minted, check out this guide to mint some nfts.

By the way we also need to connect a wallet. So if you don't have a wallet, make sure to sign up with Coinbase, MetaMask or CoinWallet.
If don't have a wallet, [you can follow this guide to create one](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet).

Alright without further ado, let's create our **marketplace**!

## Dashboard setup

The first thing we need to do is head over to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and create a **Marketplace** contract. if you don't know how to do this, check out [this guide](/learn/introduction).

Once you've created the contract, it's time to list our first NFT, but we don't need the dashboard for that! I mean we could, but why use GUI if we can use TypeScript!?

## The code

### 1. Create a TypeScript file

Go ahead and create a new TypeScript file. Let's call it `index.ts` and open it in your favorite code editor. We'll use Visual Studio code.

![](/assets/portal/guides/create-your-own-auction-with-thirdweb-typescript-sdk/19-jsfile.png)

Next up use we'll install the ThirdWeb SDK using npm!

### 2. SDK installation and setup with TypeScript

- **@thirdweb-dev/sdk** - thirdweb TypeScript SDK.
- **ethers** - will give us very useful utils.
- **dotenv** - to hide our private key.
- **typescript** - since this is a TypeScript project
- **@types/node** - typing for node as a dev dependency.
- **tslib** - utility package

```bash
npm init -y
npm install @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers dotenv
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node ts-node tslib
```

In order to make use of our SDK, you need to establish a connection to a blockchain.
Click [here](/learn-thirdweb/connect-to-blockchain) to learn how to connect to the blockchain and instantiate our SDK.

For this guide, you will need to instantiate the SDK following [these](/learn-thirdweb/connect-to-blockchain#using-your-own-signer-with-thirdweb) steps, using your own signer with thirdweb.

### 3. Define which contract to use

Now we need to define which contract we want to use. This is the contract we just created inside our dashboard.
We called the contract '**Marketplace written in TypeScript**'.
This contract has an address. We need to pass the address here. You can find the address here, under '**Marketplace written in TypeScript**':

![](/assets/portal/guides/create-your-own-auction-with-thirdweb-typescript-sdk/20-contract.png)

In our `index.ts` file we include the following code. First we define a variable `marketplaceAddress` and store our contract address in here.

Then we create an object that access the marketplace contract inside the SDK with our address.

```tsx:index.ts
// Declaring the Marketplace contract address
const marketplaceAddress = "0xC06adC34097afa2085324D4192fbE9206059f8e0"

// Initialize Marketplace contract by passing in contract address
const marketplace = sdk.getMarketplace(marketplaceAddress);

// Declaring the NFT Collection contract address
const nftCollectionAddress = "0xdd25FAEE772FbB1bcB7ba0b2cEE6387A8F82f032"

// Declaring the Token contract if you want to use your own tokens
const tokenAddress = "0x0d5fb8942eEa62093944F3e91C6Ac4e584336741";
```

### 4. Time to mint the NFT on the marketplace!

We are using the NFT that we created in our previous guide. Each NFT has `token_id`. We will pass that the following parameters to the '.list' method:

```tsx:index.ts
// Data of the auction you want to create
const auction = {
  // address of the contract the asset you want to list is on
  assetContractAddress: nftCollectionAddress,
  // token ID of the asset you want to list
  tokenId: "0",
  // in how many seconds with the listing open up
  startTimeInSeconds: 0,
  // how long the listing will be open for
  listingDurationInSeconds: 86400,
  // how many of the asset you want to list
  quantity: 1,
  // address of the currency contract that will be used to pay for the listing
  // use NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS or don't pass currencyContractAddress to use
  // the native token of the chain, (ETH for Ethereum, MATIC for Polygon, etc.)
  currencyContractAddress: tokenAddress,
  // how much people would have to bid to instantly buy the asset
  buyoutPricePerToken: "10",
  // the minimum bid that will be accepted for the token
  reservePricePerToken: "1.5",
}

const createListing = async () => {
  try {
    const tx = await marketplace.auction.createListing(auction);
    const receipt = tx.receipt; // the transaction receipt
    const listingId = tx.id; // the id of the newly created listing
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}

createListing();
```

So the only thing left is to run our code! Open a terminal and paste the following:

```bash
# Runs the typescript file
npx ts-node index.ts
```

### 5. Make a bid

Now that you've placed your first auction on your marketplace, someone can make a bid on it!
Check out the method below, that allows a user to make a bid!

```tsx:index.ts
const makeBid = async (listingId, pricePerToken) => {
  try {
    await marketplace.auction.makeBid(listingId, pricePerToken);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}

const listingId = "0";
const pricePerToken = 2.6;

makeBid(listingId, pricePerToken);
```

And run the code! (Make sure to comment the `createListing` function call if you don't want it to be run again!)

```bash
# Runs the typescript file
npx ts-node index.ts
```

## That's it!

Congratulations! You have created your own marketplace and listed your first auction!
