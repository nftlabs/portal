## What you get

This guide gives you a simple React **component** to claim a single `drop` and a **component** for a `connect wallet` button. Check the code at GitHub over [here](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/examples/tree/main/typescript/claim-button-react).

## Dependencies

Quick heads up, in these examples, the thirdweb sdk is integrated with React **components**, but we're â€˜just' using javascript. You can do the same magic with another framework!

Let's start by installing the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers
```

## The App.js - Connect your wallet

In your `App.jsx` file we can use the code from this guide for our `connect wallet` button. thirdweb created a **component** for the `connect wallet` button so we don't have to code it ourself. This is great so we don't have to mess around with private keys later.

Inside our app we import our **component** for the `claim` button.

```tsx:pages/_app.tsx
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';
import { ThirdwebProvider } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  // We'll use 4 for Rinkeby
  const desiredChainId = 4;

  /**
   * Make sure that your app is wrapped with these contexts.
   * If you're using React, you'll have to replace the Component setup with {children}
   */
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={desiredChainId}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

## The Claim button

Let's create a components under `components/ClaimButton.tsx`. If you want to know more about the **NFT Drop** contract you can find guides [here](/guides/nft-drop).

```tsx:components/ClaimButton.tsx
import { useAddress, useMetamask, useNFTDrop } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

export const ClaimButton = () => {
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();
  const nftDrop = useNFTDrop('0xA9F8815255E2fDC1CB2E164dE1bEedfD815D421B');
  const address = useAddress();
  return (
    <div>
      {address ? (
        <button onClick={() => nftDrop?.claim(1)}>Claim 1</button>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={connectWithMetamask}>Connect Wallet</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

Then, we need to import this component on our `index.tsx` file:

```tsx:pages/index.tsx
import type { NextPage } from 'next';
import { ClaimButton } from '../components/ClaimButton';

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ClaimButton />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

## That's it!

It's really **that** easy. You can see the finished code in this GitHub repo over [here](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/examples/tree/main/typescript/claim-button-react).
