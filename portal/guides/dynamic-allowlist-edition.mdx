## Introduction

In this guide, we are going to create an edition where people will be able to sign up their wallets to an allowlist and those wallets can later mint the NFT!

Sounds cool, right!? Let's get started.

## Setup

I am going to use the [Next typescript starter template of thirdweb](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/next-typescript-starter) for this guide. If you already have a Next.js app you can simply follow these steps to get started:

- Install `@thirdweb-dev/react` and `@thirdweb-dev/sdk`
- Add metamask authentication to the site. You can follow this [guide](/guides/add-connectwallet-to-your-website)
- You all are set to go now!

If you are also going to use the [Next TypeScript template](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/next-typescript-starter) then follow these steps

- Click on the use template button in the repo
- Clone the repo
- Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install # npm

yarn install # yarn
```

By default the network in `_app.tsx` is Mainnet, we need to change it to Mumbai

```tsx:_app.tsx
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';
import { ChainId, ThirdwebProvider } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

// This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
const activeChainId = ChainId.Mumbai;

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={activeChainId}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

## Creating an edition and NFT

We also need to create an edition and an NFT inside of the edition to be able to mint them to the users. So, go to the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and create an edition.

Fill out the details and deploy the contract!

Now, let's create and mint a new NFT inside of it. Fill out the details and make sure to set the initial supply to 0.
