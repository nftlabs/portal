## Quick disclaimer

---

If you don't have a a wallet, click [here](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet). If you don't know how a connection works with the blockchain, click [here](/learn/connect-to-blockchain). If you don't know how to instantiating our sdk works....click [here](/guides/sdk-guide). If all of this doesn't make sense...please go to our [starting page](/learn) ðŸ˜¬

## Install packages

```bash
//Run this to install with npm
npm install @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/hooks
```

## Create the button

Create a new folder called components that will host all custom components of your app.
Inside your `components` folder, create a file `Connect.js` with the following code ðŸ‘‡


```js:Connect.js
import { useDisconnect, useMetamask } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export const Connect = () => {
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();
  return <button onClick={connectWithMetamask}>Connect Metamask Wallet</button>;
};
```
This component will provide a button that allows you to connect to your Metamask wallet.
Check out our documentation [here](https://docs.thirdweb.com/react)
Before we can use this button, we need to add the provider to our app.ðŸ‘‡

## Choose the chain and wallet (provider and signer)

Now we need to setup our `Provider`. For this we will use the custom component of thirdweb, the `ThirdwebProvider`. Go ahead and import it.

```jsx:App.js
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

Next we need to select the chain and type of wallet we want to connect to.

With `supportedChainIds` we select the blockchain we want to connect with. We have to pass an `Id`. Every blockchain has an `Id`. We are using an `Id` instead of a `RPC url` here. (again click [here](/portal/learn/connect-to-blockchain) if you don't know how a connection with blockchain works).

```jsx:App.js
const App = () => {
  // Polygon's chain Id is 137
  const supportedChainIds = [137];
```

We include the `ThirdwebProvider` in the return statement to wrap our app in the `ThirdwebProvider` , so that the provider information is accessible from anywhere.

`ThirdwebProvider` tags should be included at the highest level, usually in react that is app.js except in next. In next it's in \_app.js

So make sure you put your `Component` within the brackets of the `ThirdwebProvider`.

```jsx:App.js
	return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={supportedChainIds}>
      <Connect /> /* our connect wallet button */
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

Here's what the whole code looks like with `Metamask` as an example in your `App.js` file.

```jsx:App.js
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
  // Polygon's chain Id is 137
  const supportedChainIds = [137];

	return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={supportedChainIds}>
      <Connect /> /* our connect wallet button */
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```
