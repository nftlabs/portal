## Quick disclaimer

---

If you don't have a a wallet, click [here](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet). If you don't know how a connection works with the blockchain, click [here](/learn/connect-to-blockchain). If you don't know how to instantiating our sdk works....click [here](/guides/sdk-guide). If all of this doesn't make sense...please go to our [starting page](/learn) ðŸ˜¬

## Install packages

```bash
//Run this to install with npm
npm install @3rdweb/react @3rdweb/hooks
```

## Create the button

Inside your `components` folder, create a file `Connect.js` with the following code ðŸ‘‡

By wrapping it in the `<nav>` tag, the button will appear in the nav bar.

```jsx:Connect.js
import { ConnectWallet } from "@3rdweb/react";

const Connect = () => {
  return
		<nav>
			<ConnectWallet />
		</nav>;
};
```

Before we can use this button, we need to add the provider to our app.ðŸ‘‡

## Choose the chain and wallet (provider and signer)

Now we need to setup our `Provider`. For this we will use the custom component of thirdweb, the `ThirdwebProvider`. Go ahead and import it.

```jsx:App.js
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@3rdweb/react";
```

Next we need to select the chain and type of wallet we want to connect to.

With `supportedChainIds` we select the blockchain we want to connect with. We have to pass an `Id`. Every blockchain has an `Id`. We are using an `Id` instead of a `RPC url` here. (again click [here](/portal/learn/connect-to-blockchain) if you don't know how a connection with blockchain works).

```jsx:App.js
const App = () => {
  // Polygon's chain Id is 137
  const supportedChainIds = [137];

```

With `connectors` we are selecting which wallets we want to support. If you want to learn more about our connect wallet component, click [here](/portal/guides/add-connectwallet-to-your-website).

MetaMask `connector` setup ðŸ‘‡

```jsx:App.js
//injected - MetaMask
const connectors = {
    injected: {},
  };
```

Coinbase `connector` setup ðŸ‘‡

```jsx:App.js
walletlink: {
    appName: "",
    url: "https://rinkeby-light.eth.linkpool.io/",
    darkMode: false,
  },
};
```

We include the `ThirdwebProvider` in the return statement to wrap our app in the `ThirdwebProvider` , so that the provider information is accessible from anywhere.

`ThirdwebProvider` tags should be included at the highest level, usually in react that is app.js except in next. In next it's in \_app.js

So make sure you put your `Component` within the brackets of the `ThirdwebProvider`.

```jsx:App.js
	return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      connectors={connectors}
      supportedChainIds={supportedChainIds}
    >
      <Connect /> /* our connect wallet button */
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

Here's what the whole code looks like with `Metamask` as an example in your `App.js` file.

```jsx:App.js
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@3rdweb/react";

const App = () => {
  // Polygon's chain Id is 137
  const supportedChainIds = [137];
  //injected - MetaMask
	const connectors = {
    injected: {},
  };

	return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      connectors={connectors}
      supportedChainIds={supportedChainIds}
    >
      <Connect /> /* our connect wallet button */
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```
