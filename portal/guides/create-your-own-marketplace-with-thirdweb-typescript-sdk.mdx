## Intro

In this guide we'll create our own **marketplace** with the TypeScript SDK! In a **marketplace** you can list your tokens, like NFT's, for sale. Opensea is an example of a **marketplace**. Did you know you can do both! After we create our **marketplace**, we will list the NFT we minted with our SDK in our previous guide. Check that guide out over [here](/guides/mint-nft-collection-using-typescript-sdk).

By the way we also need to connect a wallet. So if you don't have a wallet, make sure to sign up with MetaMask or CoinWallet. If don't have a wallet, [you can follow this guide to create one](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet).

Alright without further ado, let's create our **marketplace**!

## Dashboard setup

The first thing we need to do is head over to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and create a **Marketplace** contract. if you don't know how to do this, check out [this guide](/learn/introduction).

Once you've created the contract, it's time to list our first NFT, but we don't need the dashboard for that! I mean we could, but why use GUI if we can use TypeScript!?

## The code

### 1. Create a TypeScript file

Go ahead and create a new TypeScript file. Let's call it `index.ts` and open it in your favorite code editor. We'll use Visual Studio code.

![](/assets/portal/guides/create-your-own-marketplace-with-thirdweb-typescript-sdk/19-jsfile.png)

Next up use we'll install the ThirdWeb SDK using npm!

### 2. SDK installation and setup with TypeScript

- **@thirdweb-dev/sdk** - thirdweb TypeScript SDK.
- **ethers** - will give us very useful utils.
- **dotenv** - to hide our private key.
- **typescript** - since this is a TypeScript project
- **@types/node** - typing for node as a dev dependency.
- **tslib** - utility package

```bash
npm init -y
npm install @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers dotenv
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node ts-node tslib
```

In order to make use of our SDK, you need to establish a connection to a blockchain.
Click [here](/learn-thirdweb/connect-to-blockchain) to learn how to connect to the blockchain and instantiate our SDK.

For this guide, you will need to instantiate the SDK following [these](/learn-thirdweb/connect-to-blockchain#using-your-own-signer-with-thirdweb) steps, using your own signer with thirdweb.

### 3. Define which contract to use

Now we need to define which contract we want to use. We created the Marketplace contract and called it '**Cool NFT Marketplace**'. This contract has an address. We need to pass the address here. You can find the address here, under '**Cool NFT Marketplace**':

![See Marketplace contract address under contract name](/assets/portal/guides/create-your-own-marketplace-with-thirdweb-typescript-sdk/marketplace-contract-dashboard-view.png)

In our `index.ts` file we include the following code. First we define a variable `marketplaceAddress` and store our contract address in here.

Then we create an object that uses the market contract inside the SDK with our address.

We will also need the contract address of the NFT we want to list. To get your NFT contract address head over to the dashboard. Inside your project go to your `NFT Collection` contract and copy the address of that contract.

If you want to sell your NFT in your own token, you will also need the token contract address. Head over to the dashboard and inside your project go to your `Token` contract and copy the address of that contract and paste it below.

You can also use the native currency of the chain, such as Ether on Ethereum and Matic on Polygon.
You will need the token address of the token you want to use and pass it to the variable `tokenAddress`.

```tsx:index.ts
// Initialize marketplace contract by passing in the contract address
const marketplaceAddress = "0x51f90A2235D4D71f7A475532f8B1442a45B27530"
const marketplace = sdk.getMarketplace(marketplaceAddress);

// Declaring the NFT Collection contract address
const nftCollectionAddress = "0x8CeCAe3548f3844f68c07428E9Bbac50Ba887035"

// Declaring the token contract address if you want to use your own tokens
const tokenAddress = "0x43E0C32F2BC4A79e70421CF449e14EcADD3adbad";
```

### 4. Time to list the NFT on the marketplace!

We are using the NFT that we created in our previous guide. Each NFT has `tokenId`. We will pass that the following parameters to the '.list' method:

```tsx:index.ts
// the listingId of the listing you want to create a listing for
const tokenId = "0";
const listing = {
  // address of the contract the asset you want to list is on
  assetContractAddress: nftCollectionAddress,
  // token ID of the asset you want to list
  tokenId: tokenId,
  // in how many seconds with the listing open up
  startTimeInSeconds: 0,
  // how long the listing will be open for
  listingDurationInSeconds: 86400,
  // how many of the asset you want to list
  // For ERC721s, this value should always be 1
  // (and will be forced internally regardless of what is passed here).
  quantity: 1,
  // address of the currency contract that will be used to pay for the listing
  currencyContractAddress: tokenAddress,
  // how much the asset will be sold for
  buyoutPricePerToken: "1.5",
}

const createListing = async () => {
  try {
    await marketplace.direct.createListing(listing);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
createListing();

// Get all the listings
const getAllListings = async () => {
  try {
    await marketplace.getAllListings();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
getAllListings();

```

So the only thing left is to run our code! Open a terminal and paste the following:

```bash:virtual-env
# Runs the TypeScript file
npx ts-node index.ts
```

### 5. That's it!

Congratulations! You have created a listing on your own marketplace using the thirdweb TypeScript SDK.
