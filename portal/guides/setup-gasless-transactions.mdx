Learn more about Gassless User Experience [here](https://thirdweb.gitbook.io/thirdweb/protocol/gasless-user-experience).

Gasless Transactions require a Relayer to forward the transactions to the blockchain and pay the gas costs.

Relayer can be self-managed or through various service providers:

- [OpenZeppelin Defender](https://openzeppelin.com/defender/)
- [Biconomy Gasless](https://www.biconomy.io/gasless-page)
- [OpenGSN](https://opengsn.org/)

## Using OpenZeppelin Defender

To setup gasless transaction using OpenZeppelin Defender we would need to setup [Autotask](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/autotasks) and [Relay](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/relay).

1. Sign up for [OpenZeppelin Defender](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/)
2. Create a Relayer in the Dashboard under Relay.
   - Name: your desire name for the relayer
   - Network: the network that you want the relayer to operates in
3. Deposit gas funds into the Relayer. Transferring ETH / MATIC into the Relayer address.
4. Create an Autotask in the Dashboard under `Autotask`.
   - Name: your desire name for the autotask.
   - Trigger: set to `Webhook`
   - Connect to a relayer: Select the Relayer you just created.
   - Code: Copy the [code from our GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thirdweb-dev/ozdefender-autotask/main/src/forwarder_handler.js) and paste it in the Code box.
5. Copy the Webhook URI from the Autotask dashboard.
6. Paste the Webhook URI into the SDK constructor options. For example:

```ts
new ThirdwebSDK(signerOrProvider, {
  transactionRelayerUrl: "https://api.defender.openzeppelin.com/autotasks/...",
});
```
