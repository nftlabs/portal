With thirdweb's sdk you can interact directly with a blockchain using JavaScript or Python.
This document explains how to connect to a blockchain and use our sdk.
## Dependencies

First make sure you install the dependencies based on your choice of one of the following languages:

<InstallTabs learn />

## Read data from a blockchain
To read data from the blockchain, all you need is our `@thirdweb-dev/sdk`.
Create an `index.js` file and open a terminal where the file is located. 
Execute the code by running **node index.js**. 
Check out a live version [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-id6l9n?file=marketplace.js)


```js:index.js
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";
// This url indicates which chain you want to connect to
const rpcUrl = "https://polygon-rpc.com/";
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(rpcUrl);
// Initialize marketplace contract by passing in the contract address
const marketplaceContractAddress = "<MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>";
const marketplace = sdk.getMarketplace(marketplaceAddress);
// Get all the listings
const getAllListings = async () => {
  try {
    await marketplace.getAllListings();
    console.log(listing);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
getAllListings();
```
Side note, this is a public **RPC**. If you have your own dedicated **RPC** Alchemy or Infura**,** you can use that one instead.
Check out a live version [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-id6l9n?file=marketplace.js)

## Connect to a blockchain and deploy your smart contract
You can create a smart contract with our dashboard or in a terminal.
When you deploy a smart contract, you need to approve that transaction with your wallet.
Create a file called `deployTokenContract.js` and a file called `.env` with the following code ðŸ‘‡.
**Warning:** This method is **not** suitable for frontend, but backend.
Check out a live version of this example [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-id6l9n?file=index.js)

```js:deployTokenContract.js
//import all the packages
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()
// const rpcUrl = "https://polygon-rpc.com/";
// const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider(rpcUrl);
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(
  new ethers.Wallet(
    // Your wallet private key
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
    // RPC URL
    ethers.getDefaultProvider(
      "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/9aa3d95b3bc440fa88ea12eaa4456161"
    )
  )
);
async function deployTokenContract () {
    try {
        const tokenContractAddress = await sdk.deployer.deployToken({
            name: "My ERC-20 Token Contract",
            primary_sale_recipient: "0x55c9bBb71a5CC11c2f0c40362Bb691b33a78B764",
        })
        console.log("token contract deployed!", tokenContractAddress)
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("failed to deploy contract", error)
    }
}
deployTokenContract()

```
```bash:.env
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR WALLET PRIVATE KEY HERE NEVER SHARE IT WITH ANYONE OR UPLOAD IT ANYWHERE"
```
To run the code:
```bash
node deployTokenContract.js
```

## Use our React SDK

Our React SDK provides hooks, which provide you functionalities out of the box to use.

### Connect Wallet button with React
Here's an example. Below you can see how we get a connect and disconnect functionality and bind it to a button.
If you want to play with these hooks live, check out the playground over [here](https://connect-wallet-with-thirdweb.razazaidi2.repl.co/).
```jsx:index.js
//import the hooks
//we're just showing an example with metamask, we also have a hook for other popular wallets
import { useAddress, useDisconnect, useMetamask } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

export default function Home() {
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();
  const disconnectWallet = useDisconnect();
  const address = useAddress();

  return(
    <div>
      {address ? (
        <div>
        <h4> Connected as {address}</h4>
        <button onClick={disconnectWallet}> Disconnect wallet </button>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={connectWithMetamask}>Connect Metamask wallet</button>
      )
      }
    </div>
  )
}
```

After adjusting our app we need to give our react or nextjs a way to connect to a blockchain using a rpc url.
And we need to `wrap` our app in the thirdweb provider tag so we can use the hook functionality everywhere inside our nextjs or react project.

```jsx:_app.jsx
import { ChainId, ThirdwebProvider } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

// This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
const activeChainId = ChainId.Rinkeby;

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={activeChainId}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp

```

### Mint NFT with React
Once you're connected with your wallet, you can use our hooks to interact with your thirdweb contracts.
We have a custom hook for every of our contracts. 
Check out this example where we allow users to claim an NFT in an NextJS app.
Make sure to wrap your `_app.jsx` file with ThirdwebProvider tags, like in the previous example.
Check out a live replit over [here](https://mint-nft-with-thirdwebs-react-hooks.razazaidi2.repl.co/), where you can play with the code.

```jsx:index.jsx
//import the hooks
//we're just showing an example with metamask, we also have a hook for other popular wallets
import { useAddress, useDisconnect, useMetamask, useNFTDrop } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

export default function Home() {
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();
  const disconnectWallet = useDisconnect();
  const address = useAddress();
  //connect with our smart contract
  const nftDrop = useNFTDrop('0x7Af4e725A654Eff43ad1F57d3B3eA33a681cEa66');
  //create a mint function
  const mintNft = async () => {
    try {
      await nftDrop?.claim(1);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    } 
  };
  return(
    <div>
      {address ? (
        <div>
        <h4> Connected as {address}</h4>
        <button onClick={disconnectWallet}> Disconnect wallet </button>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={connectWithMetamask}>Connect Metamask wallet</button>
      )
      }
    </div>
    <div>
      <button onClick={mintNft}>Click here to mint NFT</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Your Web3 Stack
Building in Web3 is slightly different than web2. 
You have to consider the blockchain technology in your design and architecture.

This is a highlevel visualisation of how our sdk integrates in an app.
