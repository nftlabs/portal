With thirdweb you can mint NFTs, create drops and build your own marketplace. All of this is done inside **Projects** and **Modules**. In this guide we'll dive in what **Projects** and **Modules** are.

## Project

A **project** is a smart contract that gets deployed with your wallet. Think of this as a container holding together a set of **modules**. But what are **modules**? Keep reading ðŸ‘‡

## Modules

At first sight modules may seem smart contracts, but they are much more. **Modules** are more like packages that contain smart contracts and other features and functionalities. Let's dive into it.

### Basics

At the base a **module** is smart contract that is deployed on the blockchain is held by a **project**. Every **module** has a smart contract address that can be looked up on etherscan. In the example below, underneath `Cool NFT marketplace`, you can see the smart contract address.

This smart contract is used to define certain rules, like royalty, claim conditions etc.

thirdweb allows you to configure these rules via the dashboard ðŸ‘‡ or through the SDKs.

### Permission Manager

The cool thing about **module** is that it also allows you to manage roles. You can easily assign and revoke roles such as `Admin`, `Minter`, `Lister`, etc. These roles use the wallet address of an user. Again you can manage these roles inside a **module** via the dashboard or any of the SDKs we created.

### Working with modules inside the SDKs

Whenever you use a **module**, you need to define which **module** you want to use. A **module** has an address and you need to pass that address inside your code. Here are two examples:

```python
#pick your module and enter the smart contract address
market_smart_contract_address = "0x56c1F1f63dC507F24495E5fD56003D56FD12A7F9"
market_module = SDK.get_market_module(market_smart_contract_address)

#pick your module and enter the smart contract address
nft_smart_contract_address = "0xdd25FAEE772FbB1bcB7ba0b2cEE6387A8F82f032"
nft_module = SDK.get_nft_module(nft_smart_contract_address)

```
